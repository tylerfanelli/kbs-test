# kbs-test

`kbs-test` is an HTTP server used for testing the SVSM attestation module and proxy. `kbs-test` mimics the KBS protocol used by TEE attestation servers such as [Trustee](https://github.com/confidential-containers/trustee).

Instructions on how to use `kbs-test` to test the SVSM attestation process can be found in the [SVSM attestation documentation](https://github.com/coconut-svsm/svsm/blob/main/Documentation/docs/developer/ATTESTATION.md).
